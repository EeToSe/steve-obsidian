Excerpt of Keynote by NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang at 2024 SIEPR Economic Summit

36:10: "You know I think one of my great advantages is that I have very low expectations and I mean that. Most of the Stanford graduates have very high expectations. You deserve to have high expectations because you came from a great school, were successful and are top of your class. Obviously you're able to pay for tuition. And then you're graduating from one of the finest institutions on the planet. You're surrounded by other kids that are just incredible. You naturally have very high expectations. People with very high expectations have low resilience. And unfortunately, resilience matters in success. I don't know how to teach it to you except for I hope suffering happens to you. I was fortunate that I grew up with my parents providing a condition for us to be successful. But there were plenty of opportunities for setbacks and suffering. To this day, the phrase 'pain and suffering' inside our company is said with great glee. The reason is, 'Boy, this will cause lots of pain and suffering.' And I mean that in a happy way, because you want to train, you want to refine the character of your company. You want greatness out of them. Greatness is not intelligence, as you know. And greatness comes from character. And character isn't formed out of smart people. It's formed out of people who suffered. So that's kind of... If I could wish upon you—I don't know how to do it—but you know, for all of you Stanford students, you know, I wish upon you ample doses of pain and suffering."
