I've been involved with personal knowledge management for far too long now and wanted to share some thoughts that have come to me recently.

## My path down the rabbit hole

It all started with the tingling sensation that I wasn't getting the most out of the media I consumed. I spent a lot of time reading insightful nonfiction books, interesting articles, or brilliant blog posts, thinking about all the insights I had gained and all the new perspectives I had been offered. I felt like this would somehow change my life for the better, if only a tiny little bit. But then life went on and nothing really happened.

There had to be a way to make better use of all the insights I had gained. Somehow I wanted to save all that information for later, when it actually became relevant. I wanted to *retain what I read.*

So I started googling. A lot of people seemed to be having the same problem. And people had come up with solutions. My path down the rabbit hole led me past just about every system, tool, etc. you can think of. I read about personal wikis, building a second brain and the PARA method, digital gardens, the Zettelkasten-Method, taking smart notes, spaced repetition, you name it. Every time I thought I had found *the perfect system,* or at least the reason why my previous system was laking. Every time I thought it had clicked, I found after a while that it didn't. I was stressing about the right tool for my purposes and switched frequently as my system changed. I used Apple Notes, Evernote, Roam, Obsidian, Bear, Notion, Anki, RemNote, the Archive and a few others. I was pondering about different note types, fleeting, permanent, different organisational systems, hierarchical, non-hierarchical, you know the deal. I often felt lost about what to takes notes on and what *not* to take notes on.

Worst of all, I spent so much time taking notes and figuring out a personal knowledge management system that I neglected the things I actually wanted to learn about. And even though I kind of always knew this, I kept falling into the same trap.

## My observations

Some observations I made during the last few years were as follows:

- I barely, if ever, looked at or refered back to the bulk of notes I had created. Although some of them took a lot of time to create (I literally wrote whole book summaries for a while), their value was negligible in hindsight.
- The few notes I did refer back to frequently where checklists, self-written instructions to complete regular tasks, lists (reading lists, watchlists, etc.) or recipes. Funnily enough the ROI on these notes was a lot higher than all the permanent/evergreen/zettel notes I had written.
- Writing permanent notes was time consuming as f\*\*\*. On one side writing them helped me grasp the concepts they described on a deep level. One the other side I think this would have been possible without putting an emphasis on referencing, atomicity, deep linking, etc.
- The only time I actually refered back to those deeply linked zettel notes is when I was writing about a related topic myself. For example I had a few notes on principles of modern cryptography that came in handy when I had to write a paper about a related topic for my studies. But these cases were rare at best, most of these notes were never looked at again.
- There are different kinds of information, some of which don't make sense being recorded at all. I was struggling with what to record and what not to record for a long time. For example, I took notes on programming syntax that are just useless (most of these things can be googled in seconds and they are usually decently documented already).
- Fact-based disciplines such as natural sciences have less potential for deeply linked, atomic zettel notes than arts and humanities. There is not much to discuss about or 'generate insight' on photosynthesis, algebra or network protocols if you are not a scientist.

## My conclusion

Historically speaking, knowledge meant power. In the middle ages, anyone who knew more or was better informed than his/her peers had a considerable advantage. Today we are bombarded with new information every day and the challenge is a different one: Separating the wheat from the chaff. And naturally, personal knowledge management seems like a promising coping strategy.

However, most of the stuff I read about personal knowledge management is about systems, apps, setups or plugins, and never really about its purpose. Why bother doing all this? Although it feels really good, creating organisational systems and collecting notes for the sake of retaining the information itself is a huge waste of time and will leave you hoarding useless data. In the end, everything you record has to serve a **specific purpose** outside of 'maybe being useful someday'. For me, there are really only 3 valid reasons to write something down:

1. Checklists and its variants (self-written instructions, reading lists, recipes, code snippets etc.) for things you do on a regular basis can help do these things with less errors and thinking overhead.
2. If you want to learn something, writing it down in your own words will help with grasping the concept more deeply. The more sources you consult to help draft your description, the better. But once you got the gist, only *practical application* will help to further deepen your knowledge. You can keep your notes, but don't expect to ever look back at them, unless...
3. You write articles, books or scientific papers and write your notes in order to produce some form of text at a later stage. And even then, don't expect your thesis being magically written for you.

For everything else, I've settled on putting a reference or link to insightful resources in a note so it doesn't get forgotten and I might be able to use it at a later time, if ever.

In general, more people need to let go of the idea of creating some kind of omniscient (second) superbrain that remembers everything and subsequently makes you do everything right. The things we're really performing well at are the things we did (and repeatedly failed at) 1000 times before. Think about how you learnt to ride a bicycle. Did you read a book about riding bicycles and took notes on it? I don't think so.

Do you really want to take away something from reading all of those books and articles? Think about what you are going to (lastingly) change that represents the ideas presented in the text. Most of the time, that will be just one or two things; everything else will be lost until you pick up that book again, perhaps. But that's okay. Life is too short to spend it on personal knowledge management.

**Tl;dr:** I think personal knowledge management, in many cases, is a fruitless effort and there are generally only very few cases (see above) in which note taking actually makes sense.
