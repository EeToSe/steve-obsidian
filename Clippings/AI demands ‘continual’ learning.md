The top skill for the next generation in an AI-driven world? Learning how to learn. Speaking in Athens, [[Demis Hassabis]], CEO of Google DeepMind, said mastering this skill is crucial as AI reshapes education, work, and industries.

**The details:**
- Hassabis warned that the pace of AI change is so fast that “the only thing you can say for certain is that huge change is coming.”
- He added that AGI (when AI matches humans at most tasks) could be achieved in a decade, bringing dramatic advances and a future of “radical abundance.”
- Thriving in this era will require **meta-skills**—the ability to continually optimize the learning approach to new subjects—alongside traditional knowledge.
- Hassabis added that this phase of lifelong learning is unavoidable, noting he is sure that people will have to continually learn “throughout their careers.”

**Why it matters**: The idea of learning a single skill and working with it for 5–10 years before needing to upskill is changing. In an AI-driven world, workers and students will need to constantly track developments in their domain, find ways to stay ahead of the curve, and differentiate themselves to build successful careers.
