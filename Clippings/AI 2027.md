We predict that the impact of superhuman AI over the next decade will be enormous, exceeding that of the Industrial Revolution.

We wrote a scenario that represents our best guess about what that might look like.<sup><a href="https://ai-2027.com/footnotes#footnote-1">1</a></sup> It’s informed by trend extrapolations, wargames, expert feedback, experience at OpenAI, and previous forecasting successes.<sup><a href="https://ai-2027.com/footnotes#footnote-2">2</a></sup>

(Added Nov 22 2025: To prevent misunderstandings: we don't know exactly when AGI will be built. 2027 was our modal (most likely) year at the time of publication, our medians were [somewhat longer](https://www.listendata.com/2023/08/right-skewed-histogram.html). For more detail on our views, see [here](https://x.com/eli_lifland/status/1992004724841906392?s=20).) <sup><a href="https://ai-2027.com/footnotes#footnote-3">3</a></sup>
