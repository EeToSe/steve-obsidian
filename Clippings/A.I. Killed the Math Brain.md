## Key points

- **The Bigger Threat is to Numeracy, Not Just Literacy:** While the public panic focuses on AI's ability to write and the threat to literacy, the author argues the more immediate and significant danger is to our numeracy—our ability to use mathematics, reason quantitatively, and code.
    
- **AI is Replacing Basic Coding and Analysis:** The author points to examples like a student using ChatGPT to analyze a data spreadsheet instead of writing simple code, and the trend of "vibecoding," where developers use spoken prompts to have AI generate code, often without understanding it deeply.
    
- **Skill Atrophy is a Real Risk:** Relying on AI for coding tasks can lead to developers' skills deteriorating. The principle of "if you don't use it, you lose it" applies directly to coding and quantitative reasoning.
    
- **Major Impact on the Tech Job Market:** The trend is already affecting employment. Tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon are using AI to write large amounts of their own code, leading to layoffs and a near-total collapse in hiring for entry-level software engineers starting from 2024.
    
- **The Solution is a Return to Liberal Arts:** The author advises students to focus on fundamental studies in both mathematics and language. This broad-based knowledge is essential for adapting to a volatile job market and for developing a deeper, uniquely human understanding of how AI works—something the machines themselves cannot do.
## My takeaways

The debate isn't as simple as "liberal arts vs. technical skills". **Experience is the Ultimate Human Advantage over AI**. 

A 10-year veteran engineer leverages AI differently than a rookie:

- **The Veteran:** Uses AI as a super-powered intern. They ask it to generate boilerplate code, refactor a function, or explain a new library, but they retain **executive control**. They know _what_ to ask for, can instantly spot flawed or inefficient AI output, and understand how a small code change will impact the entire system. Their experience provides the critical context and judgment that AI lacks. AI makes them _more_ productive.
    
- **The Rookie:** May use AI as a crutch. They might ask it to "solve the problem" and copy-paste the answer without fully understanding the underlying logic. This can lead to the very skill degradation (用进废退) you mentioned. They lack the experience to validate the AI's output effectively.
    
This dynamic isn't limited to software. An experienced journalist, editor, or financial analyst will use AI to augment their research and drafting processes, while their deep domain knowledge allows them to craft a superior final product.

### The Paradox of Gaining Experience
**How do we create the next generation of 10-year veterans if AI decimates the entry-level jobs where that experience is first gained?**

Traditionally, a junior engineer learns by doing the "grunt work"—fixing simple bugs, writing basic functions, and handling routine tasks. These are precisely the tasks that AI is becoming exceptionally good at automating. If the bottom rungs of the career ladder are sawed off, we risk creating a "lost generation" of professionals who never get the chance to build that foundational experience in the first place.

### Reframing "Liberal Arts": It's Not About Art History, It's About Meta-Skills 🤔

I believe the essay's author uses "liberal arts" as shorthand for a set of **foundational, transferable meta-skills** that become more valuable when routine technical tasks are automated. It's about developing the cognitive framework to thrive in a world where the "what" and "how" of your job can change overnight.

These core skills include:

1. **Problem Framing:** Before you can solve a problem, you must define it correctly. A liberal arts education, particularly in philosophy and logic, trains you to ask the right questions, identify underlying assumptions, and approach problems from multiple perspectives. This is the first and most crucial step in effectively prompting an AI.
    
2. **Critical Thinking & Synthesis:** The future isn't about finding an answer—AI can do that. It's about evaluating multiple, often conflicting, AI-generated outputs and synthesizing them into a coherent, correct, and useful solution. This requires judgment, a skill honed by analyzing complex texts, historical events, or ethical dilemmas.
    
3. **Communication & Persuasion:** As AI handles more of the "talking to the machine" (coding), the uniquely human value shifts to "talking to other humans." You need to be able to explain complex technical decisions to non-technical stakeholders, persuade a team to adopt a new strategy, and articulate a clear vision. These are skills from linguistics, rhetoric, and literature.
    
4. **Ethical Reasoning:** As we delegate more decisions to AI, the ability to foresee and mitigate ethical risks (bias, fairness, safety) becomes a paramount human responsibility. This is the domain of the humanities.
    

### A New Model: The T-Shaped Professional 2.0

Perhaps the best way forward isn't a choice between experience and liberal arts, but an integration of both into a new model for professional development.

- **The Horizontal Bar (The Foundation):** This is no longer just "general knowledge." It's the **core meta-skills** from a liberal arts-style education: critical thinking, communication, adaptability, and ethical reasoning. This foundation allows you to learn and pivot effectively.
    
- **The Vertical Bar (Deep Expertise):** This remains your specialized domain knowledge (software engineering, medicine, law).
    
- **The Catalyst (AI):** AI is a tool that accelerates work across both the horizontal and vertical bars. It can help you research new fields _and_ write code in your area of expertise.
    
- **The Growth Mechanism (Experience):** Experience is the process of applying your foundational skills and deep expertise, using AI as a catalyst, to solve real-world problems over time.
    

In this model, the liberal arts skills aren't a replacement for technical ability or experience; they are the **operating system** that allows you to acquire and apply both more effectively throughout a long and unpredictable career. They give you the flexibility to build a new vertical bar of expertise if your original one becomes obsolete.
