Well, let me say something, as this is sort of generic. I know some of you spent a lot of time working on stuff that we put a bullet in the head of. I apologize. I feel your pain, but Apple suffered for several years from lousy engineering management. I have to say it.

There were people going off in eighteen different directions, doing arguably interesting things in each one of them. Good engineers. Lousy management. And what happened was, you look at the farm that's been created with all these different animals going in different directions, and it doesn't add up. The total is less than the sum of the parts.

And so we had to decide what are the fundamental directions we're going in, and what makes sense and what doesn't. There were a bunch of things that didn't. Microcosmically, they might have made sense; macrocosmically, they made no sense.

And the hardest thing is, when you think about focusing, right? You think focusing is about saying "yes." No. Focusing is about saying "no." Focusing is about saying "no." And you've got to say no, no, no, no. And when you say "no," you piss off people. And they go talk to the San Jose Mercury and they write a shitty article about you. And it's really a pisser, because you want to be nice. You don't want to tell the San Jose Mercury the person telling you this was just asked to leave, or this or that.

So you take the lumps. And Apple has been taking its share of lumps for the last six months in a very unfair way. And it's been taking them like an adult, and I'm proud of that. And there's more to come, I'm sure. There's more coming. I read these articles about some of these people that have left. I know some of these people. They haven't done anything in seven years. And they leave, and it's like the company's going to fall apart the next day.

So I think there'll be stories like that. They come and go.

But focus is about saying "no." And the result of that focus is going to be some really great products where the total is much greater than the sum of the parts.

And OpenDoc... I was for putting a bullet in the head of OpenDoc.

A) I didn't think it was great technology.

B) It didn't fit. The rest of the world isn't going to use OpenDoc.

And I think as a container strategy, there's some stuff in the Java space that's much better. And even the OpenDoc guys were basically trying to rewrite the whole thing in Java anyway, which was a restart. So, it didn't make sense.

## Jony Ive's reflections
This sounds really simplistic but it still shocks me how few people actually practice this um and it's a struggle to practice but is is this issue of focus. Steve was the most remarkably focused person I've ever met in my life and the thing with focus is it's not sort of like this thing you aspire to or you decide on Monday you know what I'm going to be. Focus it is a every minute a why are we talking about this this is what we're working on. You can achieve so much when you truly focus and one of the things
that Steve would say because I think he was concerned that I wasn't. He would say how many things have you said no to and I would honestly I would have these sacrificial things cuz I mean wanted to be very honest about it and so I say oh I said no to this and no to that and um he but he knew that I
wasn't vaguely interested in doing those things anyway. So there was no real sacrifice. 

What Focus means is saying no to something that with every bone in your body you think is a
phenomenal idea and you wake up thinking about it but you say no to it because you're focusing on something else.
