## A Good Past is the Best Pitch
**Q**:"How did you convince the most sought-after investor in Silicon Valley to invest in a team of first-time founders building a new product for a market that doesn’t even exist?"

**Background**: Jensen recounts how he didn't know how to write a business plan, even after buying a 450-page book on the subject. Instead, he met with his former boss from LSI Logic, [[Wilfred Corrigan]]. And He called back. “Hey, you left the company. You didn’t even tell me what you were doing. I want you to come back and explain it to me.” And so, I went back and explained it to Wilfred. And Wilfred at the end of it said, “I have no idea what you said. That’s one of the worst elevator pitches I’ve ever heard.” And then he picked up the phone, and he called [[Don Valentine]]. He called Don, and he said, “Don, I’m going to send a kid over. I want you to give him money.” He’s one of the best employees LSI Logic ever had. 

**The Lesson**: And so, the thing I learned is you can make up a great interview. You can even have a bad interview. But you can’t run away from your past, and so have a good past.

## If a Market Doesn't Exist, Create It
**Q**: " Talking about being the best, you needed to be the best among 89 other companies that were funded after you build the same thing. And then with six to nine months of runway left, you realize that the initial vision was just not going to work. How did you decide what to do next to save the company when the cards were so stacked against you?"

**Background**: The first great decision was building 3D graphics for video game marketing. So, you had this incredible technology that’s hard to commoditize and commercialize. And then you have this market that doesn’t exist. That intersection was the founding of our company. [[Don Valentine]] said, “Startups don’t invest in startups or startups don’t partner with startups.” And his point is that in order for NVIDIA to succeed, we needed another startup to succeed, and that other startup was [[Electronic Arts]].

To survive, NVIDIA realized they couldn't just create the technology; they had to actively create the market. Jensen explains, "...in order to create the conditions by which somebody could buy our products, we had to go invent this new market." The idea that company would create technology, create markets defines NVIDIA today.

**The Lesson**: A truly revolutionary company doesn't just build a product for an existing market; it builds the market for its product. This philosophy—**to create technology and create markets simultaneously**—became the defining principle of NVIDIA. It explains why they are consistently early and foundational in new fields like autonomous driving, deep learning, and computational drug discovery. They build the entire ecosystem, not just a single component.

## Your Future is just a Textbook Away
**Q**: "(This follows the previous discussion) "How did you decide what to do next to save the company when the cards were so stacked against you?""

**Background**: A couple of years after its founding, NVIDIA faced an existential threat. Microsoft introduced a standard called Direct3D, which was completely incompatible with the technology NVIDIA had invented. Jensen recalls the conversation: **“We now have 89 competitors. I understand the way we do it is not right, but we don’t know how to do it the right way.”** 
His solution was not a high-tech breakthrough, but a trip to a bookstore, Fry's Electronics. There, he found the **OpenGL manual**, which defined how high-end computer graphics were done. He bought three copies for $68 each, took them back to the office, and declared, **“Guys, I found it. Our future.”** Using the manual as their guide, his team implemented the graphics pipeline in a way "nobody had ever implemented" before, creating something the world had never seen.

That moment in time for our company gave us so much confidence. And the reason for that is you can succeed in doing something, inventing a future, even if you were not informed about it at all. And that’s kind of my attitude about everything now. When somebody tells me about something and I’ve never heard of it before, or if I’ve heard of it and don’t understand how it works at all, my first thought is always, “How hard can it be? And it’s probably just a textbook away. You’re probably one archive paper away from figuring this out.”

**The Lesson**: So, I spent a lot of time reading archive papers. And it’s true. Now, of course, you can’t learn how somebody else does something and do it exactly the same way and hope to have a different outcome. **But you can learn how something can be done and then go back to first principles and ask yourself**, “Given the conditions today, given my motivation, given the instruments, the tools, given how things have changed, how would I redo this? How would I reinvent this whole thing? How would I design it? How would I build a car today? Would I build it incrementally from 1950’s and 1900’s? How would I build a computer today? How would I write software today” Does that make sense?

So, I go back to first principles all the time, even in the company today, and just reset ourselves, because the world has changed. The way we wrote software in the past, it was monolithic, and it’s designed for supercomputers, but now it’s this disaggregated so on and so forth. How we think about software today, how we think about computers today, just always cause your company, always cause yourself to go back to first principles, and it creates lots and lots of opportunities.

## Find Your Future in the "Zero Billion Dollar" Markets
**Q**: "...in the middle of all of this success, you decide to pivot a little bit... based on a phone call you have with this chemistry professor. Can you tell us about that phone call and how you [[connected the dots?]]" 

**Background**: While NVIDIA was successfully growing its graphics business, Jensen and his team were always looking for other applications. They made their processors more programmable and created a language called "[Cg(C for GPUs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0302013)". Soon, they noticed a few researchers using it for unexpected things. A couple of doctors at Mass General were using it for CT reconstruction. A quantum chemist was using it to express his algorithms.

These were not large, profitable markets. In fact, Jensen notes, **"these researchers had no money."** For 10 to 15 years, the markets that fuel NVIDIA today simply didn't exist. There was only one market: computer graphics. Yet, instead of dismissing these niche applications, Jensen paid close attention. The fact that scientists were using their gaming technology to solve important scientific problems gave him "incrementally more confidence" that this new form of computing could change the world.
But before a market exists, you still need [[EIOFS]] - early indicators of future success. 

**The Lesson**: The earliest signs of a revolutionary market often come from users with important problems but no budget. Jensen's philosophy is not to ask about the size of the market, but the importance of the work. He calls these early signals "[[EIOFS]]". While the financial returns may be non-existent at first, finding people doing "worthy work" with your technology is the best indicator of a future billion-dollar market. You must be willing to invest in and support these users long before it makes financial sense.

## Conviction Comes from Unique Contribution 

**Q**: "How do you find the [conviction]?" (to make bets so far in advance of technology inflections)

**Background**: Jensen explains that after identifying important work, NVIDIA applies a second, more powerful filter. They don't ask about financial forecasts or business cases. Instead, they ask a simple question: "If we didn’t do it, would it happen without us?" 

He describes his joy at the idea of progress happening without him having to lift a finger as the "definition of ultimate laziness."  — you want the company to be lazy about doing things that other people always do, can do. Instead, they seek out the challenges that they are uniquely suited to solve. The goal is to find work where you can honestly say, **"If we didn’t do it, the world would fall apart."** You have to convince yourself of that, “If I don’t do this, it won’t get done.” If that work is hard, and that work is impactful and important then it gives you a sense of purpose.

**The Lesson**: Lasting conviction isn't just believing an idea is good; it's believing that your contribution is essential. When you focus on problems that only you can solve, your work transforms from a business opportunity into a **mission**. This sense of purpose provides the resilience to withstand years without a market, immense financial pressure, and widespread doubt. It's the ultimate source of strength to stick with a long-term vision.

## Anchor ⚓ to First Principles, Not the Stock Price

**Q**: "You’ve had to steer the company through some very challenging times, like when it lost 80 percent of its market cap amid the financial crisis because Wall Street didn’t believe in your bet on ML. In times like these, how do you steer the company and keep the employees motivate1d?"

**Background**: Jensen admits that when the company's stock dropped 80%, it was "a little embarrassing," and his first instinct was to not want to leave the house. However, his core operating procedure didn't change. Instead of panicking, he went back to basics and did a "gut check" on the company's core beliefs. **Do you believe in it? Did something change? The stock price changed, but did something else change?** **"Did physics change? Did gravity change? Did all of the things that we assumed that we believed that led to our decision, did any of those things change?"**
The Lesson:

External validation, like a stock price, is fickle and should not dictate your strategy. The key to navigating a crisis is to anchor yourself to your first principles. If the fundamental truths that led to your decision are still valid, then you should not change your plan, regardless of external panic or criticism. As Jensen concludes, "If none of those things changed, you change nothing, keep on going." True resilience comes from having the discipline to separate the signal (your core beliefs) from the noise (market sentiment).
## Information Should Flow, Not Trickle Down

**Q**: "Your employees say that your leadership style is very engaged. You have 50 direct reports... Can you tell us why you’ve purposefully designed such a flat organization? And how should we be thinking about our organizations...?"

**Background**: Jensen explains that his organizational structure is designed to solve a fundamental problem: the mutilation of information. Traditional top-down structures, with a CEO having only a few reports, were designed for an era where employees needed minimal information to follow orders. In contrast, Jensen wants every employee to question everything and make smart decisions on his behalf.

To achieve this, he believes information must flow freely. By having 50 direct reports, he minimizes the number of layers between himself and the rest of the company. He directly shares his reasoning process—the knowns, the unknowns, and the assumptions—with large groups of people. Quote: "If you send me something and you want my input on it and I can be of service to you and in my review of it, share with you how I reasoned through it, I’ve made a contribution to you. I’ve made I possible to see how I reason through something. And by reasoning, as you know, how someone reasons through something empowers you. You go, “Oh my gosh. That’s how you reason through something like this.” It’s not as complicated as it seems. This is how you reason through something that’s super ambiguous. This is how you reason through something that’s incalculable. This is how you reason through something that seems to be very scary."

**The Lesson**: Design your organization from first principles to serve its purpose. If you want a highly empowered and intelligent workforce, you must create a structure that maximizes the flow and context of information. As Jensen says, his job is to "create the conditions by which you can do your life’s work." This is impossible if employees don't understand the full context of the situation they're in. A flat structure reduces information distortion and empowers everyone to make better, faster decisions as if they were the CEO.

## The Future is Generative, Not Retrieval-Based 

**Q**: "Last week, you said that generative AI and accelerated computing have hit the tipping point. So as this technology becomes more mainstream, what are the applications that you personally are most excited about?"

**Background**: Jensen answers by going back to first principles. He explains that the fundamental breakthrough of generative AI is that for the first time, software can understand the meaning behind digitized information (words, images, genes, proteins). Because it understands meaning, it can now translate between different types of information—text to images, video to text, and so on. This act of translation is generation.

This leads to a profound shift in the nature of computing. Historically, computing has been **retrieval-based**, where we retrieve information that was pre-recorded.1 The future, he says, will be **highly generative**. He uses an analogy: "Very little of the information I’m conveying to you is retrieved. Most of it is generated. It’s called intelligence." Computers will now operate in a similar way.

Based on this shift, he's most excited about applications like **computer-aided drug design** (understanding the "meaning" of a cell like we understand a paragraph) and **humanoid robotics**, arguing that if you can tokenize and understand language, you can also tokenize and understand physical manipulation.

**The Lesson**: To understand the future of AI, don't just look at the applications; look at the fundamental change in how computers operate. The most transformative opportunities will not come from simply finding information faster, but from generating novel solutions, content, and actions. This shift from a retrieval model to a generative one is the core of the AI revolution and the key to identifying the most disruptive future industries.
