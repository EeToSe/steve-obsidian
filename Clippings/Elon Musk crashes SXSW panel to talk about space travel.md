## Dreams Worth Pursuing
“There are a lot of terrible things happening all over the world, all of the time,” Musk said. “There are lots of problems that need to get solved. Lots of things that are miserable and kind of get you down.”

“But life cannot just be about solving one miserable thing after another,” he added. “That can’t be the only thing. They need to be things that inspire you, that make you glad to wake up in the morning and be part of humanity. That’s why we did this.”

[[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]]: "Earth is the cradle of humanity, but one cannot live in a cradle forever". "I found that incredibly exciting. That makes me glad to be alive. I hope you feel the same way."

## Don't Wait to Start
If you go back 20 or 25 years, I wish I would have known that there was no need to wait. I went to college. I went to law school. I worked in law and banking though not for terribly long. But not until I really started PayPal did I fully realize that you don’t have to wait to start something. So if you’re planning to do something with your life, if you have a 10 year plan of how to get there, you should ask: why can’t you do this in 6 months? Sometimes, you have to actually go through the complex, 10-year trajectory. But it’s at least worth asking whether that’s the story you’re telling yourself or whether that’s the reality.

Stop being patient and start asking yourself, how do I accomplish my 10-year plan in 6 months? You'll probably fail, but you'll be far ahead of the person who simply accepted it would take 10 years.

## The 10% Goal Law
My success is due to the development of a great attitude. It's called the 10% goal law. The idea is like whatever you wanna have in your life. You have to do ten attempts. But the problem is most people don't try the ten times. The terrible truth is most people don't even wanna try it once. It's a hell of a lot harder for them to try.

While that's the point of the 10% target law. Learn to be positive regarding 90% failures. Now I dare to promise you. If you do anything in the future. You're willing to try 10 times first. Well, you'll find one of them will succeed. Either first, you'll get what you wanna have. Or second, you'll get something. You never know what you're gonna get in your life.

But usually you want to take a step back. That's what most people choose to do. And the reason is cause they actually not really fighting for it ever. You'd beat 90% of the human race in 10 tries.
