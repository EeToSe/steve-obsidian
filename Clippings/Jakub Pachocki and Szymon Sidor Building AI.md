how i find this pod: sam -> [[Jakub Pachocki]] -> nature -> his x -> latest post -> [Chain of Thought Monitorability: A New and Fragile Opportunity for AI Safety](https://www.alphaxiv.org/abs/2507.11473) seems have a lot to connect with my llm gaslighting and mother -> and this interview.


## Takeaways
- **AI's Superhuman Performance in Specific Domains**: AI already outperforms humans in certain areas, such as individual math and programming problems (0:12, 40:18). This highlights its current advanced capabilities.
- **The Shift to Empirical Understanding**: Jakub emphasizes that the success of AI, particularly with AlphaGo, forced a re-evaluation from purely theoretical foundations to viewing AI as a "physical phenomenon" that needs empirical understanding (0:57, 8:47).
- **The Importance of "Reasoning Paradigm"**: A major focus is on teaching AI models "their own way to think" rather than just emulating human thought processes. This involves models verbalizing a "chain of thought" to solve problems (31:56, 33:12, 34:48).
- **Debugging is Crucial**: Building AI often involves finding and fixing "silent bugs" where the network might still learn despite errors, making the debugging process complex and critical (24:02, 25:25, 25:59).
- **Iterative Deployment and Learning**: OpenAI's approach involves responsibly deploying AI technology incrementally to learn from its use, identify new risks, and understand how to improve it (49:24).
- **The Challenge of AI Alignment**: As AI systems become smarter and more complex, ensuring they align with human values and intentions becomes incredibly difficult. It's not just a technical problem, but also involves deciding _what_ values to align with (44:54, 50:01).
- **The Significance of Governance**: The unexpected events of November 2023 highlighted how critical robust governance structures are for AI labs, especially given the immense power and responsibility that comes with developing advanced AI (57:26, 58:11).
- **Automated Research as a Major Milestone**: Jakub sees a system capable of automated research and discovering new knowledge as a key future milestone, which could fundamentally transform society (43:10, 1:00:13).
