## Transcript
you're one of the greatest teachers of machine learning AI ever from cs231n to today what advice would you give to beginners interested in getting into machine learning beginners are often focused on like what to do and I think the focus should be more like how much you do so I I'm kind of like believer on a high level in this 10 000 hours kind of concept where you just kind of have to just pick the things where you can spend time and you you care about and you're interested in you literally have to put in 10 000 hours of work um it doesn't even like matter as much like where you put it and you'll iterate and you'll improve and you'll waste some time I don't know if there's a better way you need to put in 10 000 hours but I think it's actually really nice because I feel like there's some sense of determinism about being an expert at a thing if you spend ten thousand hours you can literally pick an arbitrary thing and I think if you spend ten thousand hours of deliberate effort and work you actually will become an expert at it and so I think it's kind of like a nice thought um and so uh basically I would focus more on like are you spending ten thousand hours that's what I'm focus on so and then thinking about what kind of mechanisms maximize your likelihood of getting to ten thousand dollars exactly which for us silly humans means probably forming a daily habit of like every single day actually doing the thing whatever helps you so I do think to a large extent is a psychological problem for yourself uh one other thing that I hope that I think is helpful for the psychology of it is many times people compare themselves to others in the area I think this is very harmful only compare yourself to you from some time ago like say a year ago are you better than you year ago this is the only way to think um and I think this then you can see your progress and it's very motivating that's so interesting that focus on the quantity of ours because I think a lot of people uh in the beginner stage but actually throughout get paralyzed uh by uh the choice like which one do I pick this path or this path yeah like they'll literally get paralyzed by like which ID to use well they're worried yeah they're worried about all these things but the thing is some of the you you will waste time doing something wrong yes you will eventually figure out it's not right you will accumulate scar tissue and next time you'll grow stronger because next time you'll have the scar tissue and next time you'll learn from it and now next time you come into a similar situation you'll be like all right I messed up I've spent a lot of time working on things that never materialize into anything and I have all that scar tissue and I have some intuitions about what was useful what wasn't useful how things turned out so all those mistakes were uh were not dead work you know so I just think you should just focus on working what have you done what have you done last week uh that's a good question actually to ask for for a lot of things not just machine learning um it's a good way to cut the the I forgot what the term will use but the fluff the blubber whatever the uh the inefficiencies in life uh what do you love about teaching you seem to find yourself often in the like drawn to teaching you're very good at it but you're also drawn to it I mean I don't think I love teaching I love happy humans and happy humans like when I teach yes I I wouldn't say I hate teaching I tolerate teaching but it's not like the act of teaching that I like it's it's that um you know I I have some I have something I'm actually okay at it yes I'm okay at teaching and people appreciate it a lot yeah and uh so I'm just happy to try to be helpful and uh teaching itself is not like the most I mean it's really no it can be really annoying frustrating I was working on a bunch of lectures just now I was reminded back to my days of 231 and just how much work it is to create some of these materials and make them good the amount of iteration and thought and you go down blind alleys and just how much you change it so creating something good um in terms of like educational value is really hard and uh it's not fun it's difficult so for people should definitely go watch your new stuff you put out there are lectures where you're actually building the thing like from like you said the code is truth so discussing uh back propagation by building it by looking through and just the whole thing so how difficult is that to prepare for I think that's a really powerful way to teach how did you have to prepare for that or are you just live thinking through it I will typically do like say three takes and then I take like the the better take uh so I do multiple takes and I take some of the better takes and then I just build out a lecture that way uh sometimes I have to delete 30 minutes of content because it just went down in alley that I didn't like too much there's about a bunch of iteration and it probably takes me you know somewhere around 10 hours to create one hour of content to give one hour it's interesting I mean is it difficult to go back to the like the basics do you draw a lot of like wisdom from going back to the basics yeah going back to back propagation loss functions where they come from and one thing I like about teaching a lot honestly is it definitely strengthens your understanding uh so it's not a purely altruistic activity it's a way to learn if you have to explain something to someone uh you realize you have gaps in knowledge uh and so I even surprised myself in those lectures like also the result will obviously look at this and then the result doesn't look like it and I'm like okay I thought I understood yeah but that's why it's really cool to literally code you run it in a notebook and it gives you a result and you're like oh wow yes and like actual numbers actual input X you know actual code yeah it's not mathematical symbols Etc the source of Truth is the code it's not slides it's just like let's build it it's beautiful you're a rare human in that sense.

## My takeaways

### 1. The 10,000-Hour Rule: Prioritize Volume and Consistency Over Perfect Choices

Instead of getting paralyzed by _what_ to do, your focus should be on _how much_ you do. The specific path you take is less important than the sheer volume of deliberate effort you put in.

- **The Core Concept:** Andrej advocates for the "10,000 hours" concept as a high-level guide. He believes there's a "sense of determinism" to becoming an expert: if you dedicate that much deliberate effort to nearly anything, you will achieve mastery.
    
- **Practical Application:** The real challenge is psychological. Ask yourself, "What mechanisms will maximize my chances of reaching 10,000 hours?" For most people, this means **forming a daily habit**. The focus should be on consistently putting in the work, day after day.
    
### 2. The Only Benchmark is Your Former Self

Comparing yourself to others is a harmful and demotivating trap. The only productive and healthy way to measure your growth is to compare yourself to who you were in the past.

### 3. Embrace "Scar Tissue": Mistakes are Essential, Not Wasted Time

Don't fear making the "wrong" choice, because the experience gained from mistakes is invaluable. Wasted time and failed projects are not dead ends; they are how you build intuition.

- **The Value of Failure:** You _will_ waste time and work on things that don't materialize. This is not just okay; it's necessary. This process builds "scar tissue."
    
- **Building Intuition:** This accumulated scar tissue gives you powerful intuitions about what works, what doesn't, and how to approach problems in the future. The mistakes of the past make you stronger and more effective for the next challenge.
    
### 4. Teach to Learn: Solidify Understanding by Explaining It

Teaching is one of the most effective ways to deepen your own knowledge because it forces you to confront the gaps in your understanding. It is not a purely altruistic activity; it's a powerful tool for self-improvement.

- **Revealing Your Gaps:** When you have to explain a concept to someone else, you quickly discover what you don't truly understand.
    
- **Code as the "Source of Truth":** Andrej highlights this with his own experience. When creating lectures, he'll run code and get a result that surprises him, proving a gap between his theoretical understanding and the practical reality. This process of building and explaining forces a much deeper, more robust level of mastery.
