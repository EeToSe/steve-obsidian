## Why we want the "Network"
![[folder-tag-network.png]]  
- **🗂️ Folders create rigid boundaries.**
	They force a premature, exclusive decision on where an idea must live. A note on the `[[Habit Loop]]`—does it belong under "Psychology" or "Productivity"? 
- **Tags** enable softer clusters  
	Tags are an improvement, allowing a note to have multiple identities. But they only answer **"What"** a note is about, not **"How"** it relates to others. A `#productivity` tag groups notes together, but the crucial relationships between them remain invisible.
- **Networks** dynamically connect ideas and evolve thinking
