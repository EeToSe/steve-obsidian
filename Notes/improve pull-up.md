[How to Improve Your Pull-up Strength Quickly and Easily](https://www.youtube.com/@RenaissancePeriodization)
Increasing your pull-ups can be a big deal. Both getting more repetitions and being able to do pull-ups with additional weight attached are very significant. A lot of folks want to know how to do more pull-ups or how to get better at one rep max testing their pull-up. We have some simple ideas. We have eight tips you can use right away to improve your ability to do pull-ups.

First, standardize your technique.  
One of the things I am not a big fan of is when people are very serious about increasing their pull-up ability, but the way they set up is they just jump, grab the bar, and start going. Where you put your hands when you jump is going to vary considerably, which makes every single set slightly different. That does not allow your body to really improve or impose its motor learning effect on the pull-up.

If you standardize everything, putting your pinkies and hands in the same place every time, wrapping or unwrapping your thumbs the same way, using the same range of motion preferably with a deep stretch at the bottom and all the way up to at least the chin, then you start to do that same pull-up over and over. Yes, your ability to do pull-ups is largely determined by your general pulling strength and how much you weigh, but a big part of it is neural efficiency and technical proficiency. Your body gets really good at what you practice all the time. If you always practice the same technique, you get really good at that technique, and since that technique is a pull-up, you will get better at pull-ups, both for more max reps and more max weight.

Next, spend time in the target rep range.  
This is a short term strategy that works for a few months. Eventually, more advanced methods will be needed, but for now this is very effective. A lot of folks who want to improve how many pull-ups they can do for reps end up doing some very odd things with repetition schemes.

Train in the rep range you actually want to improve. If you want maximum number of pull-ups, then at least in the short term do slightly weighted pull-ups, five or ten pounds on the belt, or unweighted, or barely assisted pull-ups. Stay close to your body weight and do sets close to failure. If your max set is around ten reps, you want to be very good at sets in that area, so train that rep range all the time.

If you instead train with a huge amount of weight and do sets of three to six, that will make you very strong, but when you transition to taking the weight off and testing your max reps, the transition can be weird. Your body English is different because the weight is no longer pulling you the same way, your legs start moving a lot, it feels strange, and you might cramp or get tired earlier even though you have a lot of strength. So train in the rep range you want for a few weeks and you will get a better result.

If you want the best one rep max in the pull-up, basic heavy strength work is where to train. That means sets of three to six repetitions with progressively more weight, eventually some doubles and singles, then a slightly easier workout, and after that you test the biggest pull-up one rep max you can.

Third, do pull-ups more often.  
If you really want to get good at pull-ups, and if not every pull-up workout is super hard, you can benefit from higher frequency. You might have three workouts per week in which you train pull-ups. One workout can be relatively heavy with weight added and then some bodyweight pull-ups after. Another workout, maybe on Wednesday, can be lots of bodyweight pull-ups and then assisted pull-ups that are actually lighter than normal so you can get extra high volume.

By Friday you might think that another hard high volume pull-up day would be too much. That does not mean you cannot touch pull-ups at all. You can have a workout based mostly on rows or other back movements that do not overdo the exact pull-up motion, but you still do a couple of sets of two or three pull-ups either at the beginning or end of the workout. My preference is the beginning. If you can do ten to fifteen pull-ups, then a couple of sets of two or three, focusing on great technique, gives you another technical practice session.

We are treating the pull-up like a powerlift. You might do very light deadlifts to practice technique even when you cannot handle more heavy deadlifts that week. Same principle here. A lot of people get good at pull-ups by doing them five days a week. That might be slightly suboptimal on paper, but what they are getting right is practice.

What I do not want is for you to care a lot about your pull-ups but only do them once per week. If you can do sets of ten to fifteen, and you have six other days in the week you could at least do a bit of work, you are leaving a lot of progress on the table. For many people, a few of those other training days should include serious pulling, and at least one of them can include a few very easy doubles in the pull-up to keep ingraining technique. Over time you become very good at the movement, the way top calisthenics athletes look flawless when they pull. They look like they have been doing it for a long time, because they have.

Fourth, do the right accessories.  
If you can already do sets of five, ten, or fifteen pull-ups, you can sometimes just do pull-ups in a very minimalist way. The classic jail yard workout: two sets of pull-ups, two sets of trying not to get stabbed, two sets of deciding which racial gang to join. Jokes aside, yes, if your joints tolerate it very well, you might be able to get away with mostly pull-ups and minimal assistance.

Reality is usually different. It is unlikely that someone who wants the biggest squat would only squat and never do any assistance work. No sport trains only the sport itself. If the sport has pull-ups, then why would you train only pull-ups and nothing else. There are intelligent assistance exercises that help you.

These include assisted pull-ups, which let you do higher reps and focus on technique better. Weighted pull-ups let you load the movement much heavier. They have two benefits. First, your overall pull-up strength increases. Second, there is a potentiation effect: after getting used to doing pull-ups with weight hanging from you, when you take the weight off your body feels very light. Even if you are a bit fatigued, doing just your body weight feels insanely easier. Performance goes up and confidence goes way up.

Lat pulldowns, rows, bicep curls, and hammer curls are all useful. Will having bigger biceps help your pull-ups. Of course. Biceps are part of the movement. Being able to hammer curl a lot of weight for sets of ten will carry over. You cannot always be sure that pull-ups alone give you enough biceps or back volume, so extra volume from assistance exercises can fill the gaps and make you better.

So look at improving your pull-ups with a big picture mindset instead of thinking you must only do pull-ups. Even some of your favorite calisthenics folks who currently only do pull-ups will, as the community becomes more scientifically literate, move toward more intelligent assistance and more use of weighted equipment. If you can do ten pull-ups with twenty five pounds hanging from you, there is not much you cannot do with just your body weight.

Fifth, progress the pull-up style itself.  
This is more advanced and is especially useful if you only have a pull-up bar, like in some semi abandoned Soviet style playground or a half constructed Chinese megacity park that shows up in calisthenics videos. If you have no access to weight equipment at all and only a bar, you can still progress. Of course you can add repetitions, use RIR or RPE and do all that normal stuff.

But if you get really good at pulling to your chin, you can add more advanced versions. You may still do chin level pull-ups, but fresh at the start of the workout you can do pull-ups to the clavicles. If you can touch the bar to your clavicles in a pull-up, you are very strong. The number of chin level pull-ups you can do will shoot up because clavicle pull-ups are much harder.

If you become comfortable doing ten plus clavicle pull-ups, maybe with pauses at the top, you can go to sternum pull-ups, which are insane. That is when you touch the bar to your nipple line. Think about your own nipples for a second, then imagine pulling until the bar touches them. That is a serious pull-up. If I see someone do ten sternum pull-ups, when they turn around the sun basically goes dark because their back is so big. Regular chin level pull-ups for them become almost infinite.

So if you only have a bar, you can cycle through these three variations. Do the hardest ones first, then the easier ones. A sample workout for a very strong athlete might be two to three sets of sternum pull-ups, then two to three sets of clavicle pull-ups, then two to three sets of chin level pull-ups. Go home, recover your lats, come back in a few days and repeat, adding a rep to each set or to every other set over time.

Sixth, vary the pull-up styles.  
Yes, it is possible that you do overhand pull-ups forever, never get joint pain, and never feel stale. That is possible, but unlikely. More likely is that for a few months you feel great with one or two styles, and then they start to feel off or stale. That does not mean you must stop doing pull-ups. Pull-ups are awesome partly because there are many varieties.

There is wide grip, narrow grip, close grip, underhand grip, and neutral grip on parallel handles. There are all kinds of specialty handles, including those weird attachments that look like, well, you know. My recommendation is to pick one or two styles and train them hard for a few months. When they feel stale, replace one or both with other variants.

For example, you could do a few months of overhand wide grip and underhand pull-ups. When those plateau, switch to narrow grip and neutral grip pull-ups on those hanging handles. You get variation, but you are still doing pull-ups. There is huge general strength transfer. If you can now do five more reps than before in one style, you will very soon do more reps in the previous style when you come back to it, because it is almost the same muscles.

So ride each style until progress slows, switch to new variants, ride those, and repeat. That injects variation into your training indefinitely and keeps you getting stronger. Eventually you are not just pulling your body to the bar, you are pulling the Earth down to your body.

Seventh, if you can do fewer than five pull-ups, you are in a special situation.  
If you can only do a couple of pull-ups, you cannot accumulate much training volume with pull-ups alone. Your body might be able to handle a lot more volume and adapt much better, but the exercise choice limits you.

Think of it like squatting. Suppose your max squat is three hundred pounds and the only bar you have is welded with plates so it always weighs two hundred seventy five pounds. That is basically your two rep max. You can only ever squat near maximal loads. You cannot take plates off. That is the same logic as refusing to do assistance work for pull-ups when you can only do singles, doubles, or triples.

If that same person had access to a normal rack, free plates, a hack squat, and a leg press, and you watched them only do doubles in the welded rack, you would say they are missing out on tons of effective volume. They could do sets of five to ten on other machines, accumulate lots of volume, grow more muscle, and get much stronger, then come back and hit more reps in the welded rack.

Same for pull-ups. If you can do fewer than five, you should not insist on pull-ups as your only major movement. You can still have workouts where you start with a few sets of triples and then do other work. But other days should start with assisted pull-ups where you gradually reduce the assistance over time, or with lat pulldowns, or with rows. Some workouts might even start with curls or hammer curls to build the arm strength that contributes to pulling.

Most people put on the best size in sets of five to thirty reps. If you cannot do that with bodyweight pull-ups yet, then for size and strength you should use exercises you can scale to that rep range. I promise that if you start at lat pulldowns with one hundred pounds for sets of ten and you can only do two pull-ups, and eventually you work up to doing the same rep schemes with one hundred thirty, one hundred forty, or one hundred fifty pounds on the pulldown, you will be able to do many more pull-ups. That will work much better than just doing near max pull-ups all the time.

Lastly, this is a huge tip that might sound a bit harsh, but it is true: lose weight.  
I mean you specifically. Not the person behind you, not your cat, not the adult film running on a television screen in your living room. Who even watches that on a TV anymore.

It all depends on how badly you want to do more pull-ups. If you weigh one hundred eighty pounds and carry a noticeable amount of extra fat, that is not a moral failing. We all still like you. But if in your heart you really want to do more pull-ups and you are willing to do what it takes short of committing a felony, then intelligently losing five, ten, or even twenty pounds over weeks and months can skyrocket your pull-up ability.

The people who are best at pull-ups are almost all relatively small. Their strength to bodyweight ratio is excellent. Even many world’s strongest man winners can only do about ten pull-ups, because they weigh three or four hundred pounds. That is an extreme case, but the same principle applies at normal bodyweights.

I personally went from around two hundred fifty pounds down into the two hundred forty range during a mini cut. My ability to do pull-ups noticeably improved. I went from just doing bodyweight to attaching ten pounds and hitting new personal records.

Think back to that welded squat bar example. If you could somehow saw off twenty five pounds of steel so it weighs two hundred fifty instead of two hundred seventy five, you can do more reps even at the same strength. If at the same time you also keep training and get stronger, the gap between your strength and your bodyweight widens. Over a few weeks and especially a few months, you will see a very clear improvement in how many pull-ups you can do.

提高引体向上能力：快速又省力的八个技巧（中文版整理）

下面是对原文内容的信达雅整理，在不删减技术细节的前提下，稍作精简，让中文读者更容易理解和应用。

---

## 总体思路

想在引体向上上变强，主要有两件事：

- 提高重复次数
    
- 提高负重引体向上的重量（1RM 或低次数大重量）
    

引体向上表现由三部分决定：

1. 上肢和背部的总体拉力水平
    
2. 自身的体重
    
3. 神经效率和动作技术熟练度
    

下面八个技巧，既能帮你增加总次数，也能提高负重引体向上的能力。

---

## 一、标准化你的技术

很多人明明很在乎引体向上，却每一组的准备动作都不一样：  
随手一跳抓杆，手距完全靠随机，脚乱晃，动作幅度也不固定。这样每一组在神经系统看起来都是“不同的动作”，非常不利于形成稳定的技术和神经适应。

建议你做到以下“标准化”：

- 手的位置
    
    - 每次抓杆时，双手落在同一个位置
        
    - 可以记住“小指对准某个标志点”，每次都一致
        
- 手的握法
    
    - 大拇指是包住还是不包杆，选一种，固定下来
        
- 动作幅度
    
    - 底部完全伸展，感觉到背阔肌和肩的“被动拉伸”
        
    - 顶部至少下巴超过横杆
        
    - 能做到的话，尽量做到胸骨、锁骨高度的高位引体
        

这样你“反复练习的是同一个动作”，神经系统会对这个具体动作产生高度适应。  
长期坚持，你的技术效率会明显提升，同样的力量水平能做出更多次数，负重能力也会上去。

---

## 二、在目标次数区间内训练

这是一个短期非常有效的策略，通常可以高效使用几周到几个月。

核心原则：  
**想在哪个次数区间变强，就在那个次数区间训练。**

### 1. 想提高最大连续次数

如果你目前最大组数在 8到15次之间，可以这样做：

- 使用接近体重的强度
    
    - 自重引体
        
    - 稍微负重（腰带挂 2到5公斤）
        
    - 或者轻度辅助引体（弹力带或器械稍微减重）
        
- 主要训练区间
    
    - 在你最大次数附近反复训练
        
    - 例如你最大能做 10 次，多做 6到10次的组
        
    - 每组接近力竭，保留 0到2 次左右的预留（RIR 0到2）
        

如果你只做大重量、低次数（例如负重很重，只做 3到6次），虽然力量会变强，但转回自重测试最大连续次数时会很“别扭”：

- 身体摆动不同
    
- 腿的姿势不同
    
- 身体感觉不协调，很快抽筋或提前疲劳
    

所以在准备冲击最大连续次数的阶段，用几周时间，把训练重点放在你希望变强的次数区间，会更有效。

### 2. 想提高负重引体的 1RM

如果目标是一次最大负重（1RM），那就需要按传统力量训练方式来：

- 主力区间：3到6 次的重负重引体
    
- 周期安排：
    
    - 先用 3到6 次起步，逐渐加重
        
    - 后期加入双次（2次）和单次（1次）
        
    - 然后进行一到两次相对轻松一点的训练
        
    - 接着安排正式测试你最大一次负重引体
        

---

## 三、增加引体向上的训练频率

如果你真的想在引体向上上变强，而且不是每一节训练都做到“累到不行”，那么适度提高频率非常有效。

一个典型的每周三次安排示例：

- 周一：偏重负重与强度
    
    - 负重引体（3到6次组）为主
        
    - 然后做几组自重引体
        
- 周三：偏重总量和肌肉量
    
    - 大量自重引体（中高次数）
        
    - 再加辅助引体（略轻于体重），做更高总次数
        
- 周五：轻技术练习 + 其他拉力动作
    
    - 这一天如果你已经很疲劳，可以以划船、下拉、其他背部训练为主
        
    - 但在训练开始时，加 2到3 组非常轻松的引体，每组 2到3次，专注技术
        

这样做的好处在于：

- 周一、周三是“正式训练”
    
- 周五的轻松引体更像是“技术练习”，帮助你保持动作模式稳定
    
- 长期下来，你相当于在一周中多次“告诉神经系统：这个动作很重要”，进步会更快
    

很多人在现实中是每周做五次引体向上，虽然理论上可能不是“完美编程”，但他们做对的一件事是：**大量重复练习动作本身**。

如果你很在意引体向上，却只每周做一次，而且还能一组做 10到15次，其实浪费了很多潜在进步空间。你本可以在其他几天加上不同形式的拉力训练，再插入少量高质量、低疲劳的引体向上练习。

---

## 四、合理使用辅助训练动作

如果你已经能做 5、10甚至 15 次引体向上，确实可以采用“极简方式”，比如：

- 每次训练就是几组引体向上
    
- 其他什么都不做
    

只要关节完全没问题，这样也能进步。不过，对大多数人而言，**只做引体而没有任何辅助训练，往往不是最优方案**。

就像深蹲一样，几乎没有人只做深蹲而完全不练任何辅助动作。任何运动项目都不会只做比赛动作。

对引体向上来说，合理的辅助动作包括：

- 辅助引体（减重版）
    
    - 可以在更高次数区间里练习技术和肌肉耐力
        
- 负重引体
    
    - 可以显著提高整体拉力水平
        
    - 还有“激发效应”：适应了腰间挂铁片，再回到自重，会感觉特别轻松
        
- 高质量的器械训练
    
    - 高位下拉
        
    - 各种划船（杠铃划船、哑铃划船、器械划船）
        
- 手臂训练
    
    - 二头弯举
        
    - 锤式弯举
        

二头肌在引体向上中扮演很重要的角色，你弯举能力提升，对引体向上几乎一定有帮助。  
如果你只做引体，可能总训练量不够，而额外的拉力和手臂训练正好可以补足这些缺口。

从大局看待你的引体向上：  
不要认为“只要一直做引体”就是最科学的方式。  
很多现在只练自重运动的高手，将来随着训练科学的普及，也会开始更系统地使用器械和负重训练。

如果你能做到：  
自重加 10公斤甚至 20公斤做 10 次，那么只做自重引体的任何要求，对你来说都不再是难题。

---

## 五、在“引体动作本身”上做难度进阶

这个部分尤其适合只有一根单杠、没有器械、只能做自重训练的人。比如一些老式室外健身区、操场、或城市公共健身区。

即使没有负重装备，你仍然可以通过“动作进阶”变难。

基本路径如下：

1. 从“下巴过杆”标准引体开始
    
2. 逐步进阶到“锁骨引体”
    
    - 目标：拉到横杆碰到锁骨或上胸
        
    - 一旦你能做 10 次锁骨引体，你的下巴过杆引体次数会显著上升
        
3. 再进一步进阶到“胸骨引体（胸口引体）”
    
    - 目标：横杆碰到乳头线附近，也就是胸骨区域
        
    - 能做到 10 次胸骨引体的人，背部通常非常强壮，普通的下巴过杆对他们来说几乎像“无限次”
        

没有负重也可以安排这样的训练结构：

- 先做最难的版本，再做较容易的版本
    
- 示例（针对很强的训练者）：
    
    - 2到3 组胸骨引体
        
    - 2到3 组锁骨引体
        
    - 2到3 组下巴过杆引体
        

每次训练略微增加每组的重复数，比如每组加 1 次，或者每两次训练增加一次。  
几周后，你的整体拉力水平和普通引体表现都会大幅提升。

---

## 六、适当变换握法和风格

有些人一辈子只做宽握正手引体，也能一直练得不错，关节不痛，成绩也提升。  
但更多情况下，长期只做一个版本，会出现：

- 关节开始隐隐不舒服
    
- 训练感觉“很乏味”
    
- 动作出现平台期
    

引体向上之所以好玩，很大原因是变化很多：

- 宽握正手
    
- 窄握正手
    
- 反手（类似引体划船，但仍是垂直拉）
    
- 中立握（双手掌心相对）
    
- 悬吊把手、各种特殊握柄
    

建议按周期来使用变化：

1. 每次选择一到两种版本，重点练几个月
    
    - 例如：宽握正手 + 反手引体
        
2. 感觉关节不舒服或进步明显减缓时，换一两种
    
    - 换成窄握 + 中立握
        
3. 接着再把之前的版本轮回回来
    

好处在于：

- 你一直在做“非常相似的动作模式”
    
- 力量有很强的“转移效应”：
    
    - 某个版本多了 5 次，换回旧版本，通常很快也会提高
        
- 这样可以长久维持进步，不容易“卡死”在某一处
    

长期坚持，你不仅是在“把身体拉向杠”，更像是在“把地球拉向你”。

---

## 七、如果你目前连 5 个引体向上都做不到

这种情况需要特别策略。

如果你最大只能做 1到4 次，那么仅靠自重引体，很难累积足够训练量。你的肌肉本可以承受更多有效训练，但动作本身强度太高，次数太少，限制了你的进步空间。

可以用一个深蹲类比：

- 你的最大深蹲是 140 公斤
    
- 但是你现在只有一根焊死的杠铃，永远是 130 公斤，不能减重
    
- 那你每次训练只能做 1到3 次的深蹲，没法做 8到12次的肌肥大训练
    
- 明显浪费了潜在的训练效果
    

冥顽不化，坚持“只做自重引体”的人，就像只在那根焊死的杠铃下做双次深蹲，而完全不去用其他器械。

更聪明的做法是：

- 用可调重量的动作大幅累积训练量，例如：
    
    - 高位下拉
        
    - 辅助引体（器械减重、弹力带减重）
        
    - 各种划船
        
    - 二头、锤式弯举
        
- 在这些动作上练到：
    
    - 常见的增肌区间：每组 5到30 次
        
    - 累积足够总量，逐渐增加重量
        

具体建议：

- 一部分训练日
    
    - 用自重引体开头，做几组 1到3 次
        
    - 然后转向高位下拉、划船等，把训练量补足
        
- 另外一部分训练日
    
    - 直接从辅助引体或下拉开始
        
    - 逐渐降低辅助力度或增加下拉重量
        
    - 比如：从 45 公斤下拉 10 次，慢慢练到 60、65、70 公斤仍能做同样次数
        

你会发现，等下拉重量和次数明显提升时，即使期间自重引体做得不多，再回头测试自重引体，次数也会大幅上升。  
这比“每次都只做极限 1到3 次引体”有效得多。

---

## 八、最后一个非常重要的建议：减重

这个建议听起来很直接，但对引体向上确实至关重要。

如果你体重偏高，而且有明显体脂多余，即使力量不弱，引体向上的难度也会很大。  
引体向上本质上是一个“力量除以体重”的项目，谁的力量体重比高，谁更厉害。

- 世界上引体最强的人，大多体型偏小、很精瘦
    
- 许多世界最强壮的力量举、强人选手，体重 150到180 公斤，也未必能做很多引体，常常也就在十几次左右
    

对于普通训练者：

- 如果你现在 80 公斤，有明显多余体脂
    
- 在保持力量训练的前提下
    
- 用合理饮食控制，慢慢减掉 3到5公斤甚至 8到10 公斤
    
- 你的引体向上次数通常会出现“跳跃式”提升
    

可以再用之前的深蹲例子理解：

- 杠铃从 130 公斤变成 120 公斤
    
- 在完全不变强的情况下，你已经能做更多次数
    
- 如果你在减重过程里还持续训练，力量又有所提升，那“力量 ÷ 体重”的比例会明显变大
    
- 引体向上的表现就会水涨船高
    

作者自己的经验：

- 体重从约 113 公斤减到 108 到 110 公斤之间
    
- 引体向上表现明显提高，从只能做自重，到可以挂 5公斤、10 公斤创下新纪录
    

如果你真心想在引体向上上变强，而且愿意做出努力，那么：

> 提升力量训练 + 合理安排引体频率与辅助动作 + 在需要时适度减脂  
> 这三者结合起来，能在几周到几个月内给你非常直观的进步。


# 精确个人训练计划
很好，你现在这些数据已经足够制定一个相当精确的计划。

- 体重: 78 kg
    
- 体脂: 21% 左右
    
- 自重引体: 严格动作 1 个
    
- 辅助引体机: 支撑 30 kg 时可以做 6 个
    

这说明你目前可以完成的“有效拉力”大致是  
78 − 30 ≈ 48 kg 做 6 次，自重 78 kg 做 1 次，非常符合“力量差一点就能多起来”的状态，是非常容易突破到 3 到 5 个的阶段。
## 一、训练总思路

目标阶段性设置为:

1. 先从 1 个稳定到 3 个
    
2. 再从 3 个提升到 5 到 8 个
    

核心策略有三条:

1. 保持高频率接触引体动作，例如每周 3 次
    
2. 用辅助器械和其他拉力动作补足“有效训练量”
    
3. 在不过度的前提下，缓慢减掉少量体重，提高力量体重比
    

---

## 二、每周训练频率和结构建议

建议每周 3 天专门安排引体相关训练，例如:

- 周一: 重点力量日
    
- 周三: 重点训练量和肌肉量
    
- 周六: 混合日, 带一点技术和强度
    

如果你还有其他力量训练, 可以把引体部分放在训练一开始完成。

---

## 三、单次训练的模板结构

每一节训练都按照以下顺序进行。

### 1. 自重引体的“技术单次”练习

目的:  
让神经系统频繁接触真实自重, 但不过度疲劳。

做法:

- 每次训练开始时
    
    - 做 3 到 5 个“单次”
        
    - 每次都是从完全放松的悬垂到尽全力向上拉
        
    - 每做 1 次就休息 40 到 60 秒
        
- 如果偶尔只能拉到半程
    
    - 也没关系, 到达你能到的最高点
        
    - 然后用脚稍微辅助到顶端位置, 再做一个缓慢离心
        

注意:

- 每次都用同样的握距
    
- 胸部挺起, 不要耸肩
    
- 不要追求“连续次数”, 这里只练“单次质量”
    

这一部分很像“神经热身”和技术强化。

### 2. 辅助引体机主训练

你现在辅助 30 kg 可以做 6 个, 说明这是接近你当前能力上限的重量。  
为了训练效果, 我们不建议每组都做到极限。

#### 周一: 力量偏重

- 动作: 辅助引体
    
- 组数: 4 组
    
- 次数: 每组 4 到 6 次
    
- 疲劳程度: 每组保留 1 次左右余力
    

负荷设置:

- 周 1 起步时, 可以把支撑重量稍微调大一点
    
    - 例如支撑 32 到 35 kg, 让你比较稳妥地完成 4 到 6 次
        
- 每周的目标是:
    
    - 当某一天你能在某个支撑重量下, 每组稳定完成 6 次, 而且感觉还有余力
        
    - 下一次训练就把支撑重量调小 2.5 到 5 kg
        

例如:

- 周 1: 支撑 35 kg, 4 组, 每组 5 次
    
- 周 2: 支撑 32.5 kg, 4 组, 每组 5 到 6 次
    
- 周 3: 支撑 30 kg, 4 组, 每组 5 到 6 次
    

这样你是在让“真实有效拉力”逐渐接近体重。

#### 周三: 训练量偏重

- 动作: 辅助引体
    
- 组数: 3 到 4 组
    
- 次数: 每组 8 到 10 次
    
- 疲劳程度: 每组保留 1 到 2 次余力
    

负荷设置:

- 比周一支撑重量略大一些, 例如多支撑 5 kg 左右
    
- 目的是多做次数和总量, 堆肌肉和耐力
    

例如:

- 周一: 支撑 30 kg, 4 组, 5 次
    
- 周三: 支撑 35 kg, 3 组, 8 到 10 次
    

#### 周六: 混合日

- 动作: 辅助引体
    
- 组数: 3 组
    
- 次数: 每组 6 到 8 次
    
- 疲劳程度: 保留 1 到 2 次
    

负荷设置:  
介于周一和周三之间, 或者用周一的重量, 但不过度训练。

### 3. 离心引体和静力停留

这一部分对“从 1 个到 3 个”尤其有效。

安排在辅助引体之后:

- 先用脚或者借力跳到引体顶端位置
    
- 收紧肩胛, 胸部挺起
    
- 然后缓慢下放 3 到 5 秒
    
- 每次训练做 3 到 5 次离心即可, 中间休息 30 到 60 秒
    

可以逐周进阶:

- 周 1到2: 3 秒下放
    
- 周 3到4: 4 秒
    
- 周 5到6: 5 秒
    

如果精力允许, 在最高点停留 1 秒, 在中间位置也短暂停留 1 秒。

### 4. 其他拉力辅助动作

为了让整体拉力和肌肉量提高得更快, 建议每次训练再加入:

#### 高位下拉

- 组数: 3 组
    
- 次数: 8 到 12 次
    
- 每组保留 1 到 2 次余力
    
- 选择与引体动作模式相近的握距和握法
    

目标是:  
几周内逐渐把相同次数下的重量提高。

#### 划船动作

可选:

- 杠铃划船
    
- 哑铃划船
    
- 器械坐姿划船
    

安排:

- 组数: 3 组
    
- 次数: 8 到 12 次
    

目的:  
增加中背、下背和整体背部厚度, 提升稳定性和自重控制能力。

#### 二头肌训练

可选:

- 哑铃弯举
    
- 杠铃弯举
    
- 锤式弯举
    

建议:

- 每次训练选 1 到 2 种
    
- 每种做 2 到 3 组, 每组 10 到 15 次
    

二头更强, 引体会明显更轻松。

## 四、六到八周的阶段性目标与测试

可以这样安排目标和测试节奏。

### 第 1到2 周

重点:

- 适应频率和训练量
    
- 把技术标准固定下来
    

自重部分:

- 每次训练的“单次”练习里, 能稳定做出 1 个完整引体就是成功
    
- 偶尔第二次能做出一点幅度也很好
    

辅助部分:

- 找到一个“你可以稳稳完成目标次数”的支撑重量, 不要每组做到极限力竭
    

### 第 3到4 周

目标:

- 辅助引体支撑重量略有下降
    
- 辅助引体总次数略有增加
    
- 自重单次逐渐出现“偶尔能做 2 次”的情况
    

测试方法:

- 每 1到2 周, 在某次训练一开始, 做一次“最大连续自重引体”, 不需要非常频繁
    
- 记录最大连续次数, 然后当天再照常进行训练结构
    

### 第 5到6 周

期待效果:

- 在热身充分的情况下, 最大连续自重引体可以达到 2 到 3 个
    
- 辅助引体的支撑重量比第 1 周减少 5 到 10 kg, 但次数和组数仍然保持
    

如果此时你已经能稳定做 3 个, 后续再继续 2 到 4 周, 通常很有机会冲到 5 到 6 个。

## 五、体重管理对引体向上的帮助

你现在 78 kg, 体脂率约 21%。粗略估算:

- 脂肪质量大约 16 kg
    
- 去脂体重约 62 kg
    

如果你在保持肌肉量的前提下, 温和减到 75 kg 左右, 那会明显提高力量体重比。

建议:

1. 控制减重速度
    
    - 每周减 0.3 到 0.5 kg 属于比较安全和可持续的速度
        
2. 维持较高蛋白摄入
    
    - 每天大约 1.6 到 2.0 g 蛋白质每 kg 体重, 对你大约是 125 到 155 g 蛋白质
        
    - 保持力量训练的前提下有助于维持肌肉
        
3. 适度制造热量缺口
    
    - 日常饮食比你维持体重所需的热量少 300 到 500 大卡左右
        
    - 同时保持训练, 身体会倾向于保留肌肉和动用脂肪
        

这样做的效果是双重的:

- 绝对拉力在训练中缓慢变强
    
- 自身体重略有下降, 自重引体难度下降
    

最终在杠上体感会明显变轻。

## 六、如何判断训练是否过量或不足

可以用以下几个简单标准自检。

可能训练过量时的信号:

- 前臂和肘部持续酸痛超过 3 天
    
- 握力明显下降, 辅助引体次数持续下滑
    
- 睡眠质量变差, 心率长期偏高
    

如果出现这些情况:

- 临时把一周 3 次减为 2 次
    
- 或者把当周的组数和次数减少三分之一
    

可能训练不足的信号:

- 每次训练结束依然感觉很轻松
    
- 辅助引体的支撑重量几周都没变化
    
- 自重最大次数 3 到 4 周完全没有提升
    

如果是这种情况:

- 每次训练多加 1 组辅助引体或下拉
    
- 或者每次多做 1 到 2 次离心引体
