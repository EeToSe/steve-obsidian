# Hey
## **Preface**

I'm writing this in English because I feel it allows me to convey my thoughts more faithfully. I think there is a disappointing or even desperate trend of [language corruption](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/politics-and-the-english-language/) in [modern Chinese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_eHivAe9jk&t=208s). I quote George Orwell here “If thought corrupts _language_, _language_ can also _corrupt_ thought.”

Since our parents led the conversation the last time we met, we didn't get a real chance to talk. I believe the best way to explore a serious relationship is to first build a strong foundation of mutual understanding. And so this is an *experiment* in describing myself and the life I hope to build with a partner as earnestly, openly and honestly as I possibly can. My hope is that you might resonate with what I’ve written.

## **About Me**

Straight, Born in 1995, 178cm, 77kg, Monogamous.

## Pros

- I am **kind, honest, easy-going, and responsible**.
- I value a **balance between intellectual pursuits and physical fitness**. My last health screening showed my body age is 27.    
- I lead a clean lifestyle: I **don’t drink, smoke, gamble, or use any illegal drugs**.

## Cons
- I tend to be **slow to warm up** in a romantic relationship.
- I live with mild **anxiety and perfectionism**. This can manifest as worrying about not being good enough, and sometimes holding a partner to my own high standards.
- I’m **not naturally assertive** and have to consciously push myself to navigate important disagreements. I know that healthy conflict is vital for exchanging ideas, but I often find it difficult and am slow to initiate it.
- I'm at a **pivotal career stage**, which currently consumes most of my time and energy. This means I may have limited time to dedicate to you and your emotional needs at this moment.

## How I spend my time

I'm generally a homebody, and my free time is usually spent on:

- **Reading & Thinking:** I enjoy quiet learning and reflection with music.

- **Exercise:** Strength training at the gym and playing basketball.

- **Gaming:** I enjoy the strategic challenge of _Magic: The Gathering Arena_ (MTGA) and the process of reinforce my skills (I am also fascinated by [modern reinforcement learning](https://www.reinforcement-learning-for-mtg.com/downloads/MTG_with_RL.pdf)).

## We might be a great match If...

- You aspire to live with **high integrity**. This means being honest even when it’s difficult, genuinely seeking truth, and forming your own moral compass rather than simply adopting one from a social or political movement ([my views on packaged opinion](https://x.com/shengli_seu/status/1878086297769980314)). To be clear, I’m not some perfect paragon of these values myself! But I feel a deep connection, trust, comfort and respect with those who share these values.

- Our shared vision is for a life that's both **simple and passionate**, built on a genuine desire to create a family together. To have a family, not just because it’s a thing people do by default, but because it’s an adventure we’re both deeply excited for and invested in. To be trying to learn, together, how to make it beautiful and meaningful and alive, even when there are tricky moments.

- You would enjoy the simple pleasure of **cooking meals together**.

Dating profiles are often just a polished snapshot. I’ve tried my best to be sincere here, but this is still a limited self-view. My goal is for this to be a starting point for getting to know me, with the hope that we can explore the rest in the rest of our life.
