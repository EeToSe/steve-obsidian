- **Three Main Surfaces** (0:43):
    - **Agent Manager** (0:51): A central place to manage and create agents across all workspaces.
    - **Antigravity Editor** (1:09): An editor with features like tab autocomplete and an agent sidebar, allowing developers to take over from the agent and finalize tasks.
    - **Browser** (1:20): An integrated browser with an agent that can autonomously test features by interacting with the screen (1:27).
- **Agent-Assisted Development** (1:47): The LLM (Large Language Model) automatically decides when to take action. For easy tasks, the agent implements them directly, but for more complex issues or questions, it may ask for user input (1:51-2:07).
- **Artifacts** (3:34): The agent generates markdown files to track its progress, conduct research, and generate findings. These include:
    - **Task List** (3:51): To track the agent's progress.
    - **Implementation Plan** (4:08): Specs out research and reports what the agent will do before making code changes (4:10-4:18).
    - **Walkthrough** (4:20): Communicates what the agent did and the verification steps taken to prove task completion, often including screenshots or terminal commands (4:22-4:36).
- **Parallel Task Execution** (6:10): Users can have the agent work on tasks in the background, such as researching APIs (6:21) or designing logos (6:49), while the user focuses on other complex tasks.
- **Integration with Google DeepMind Ecosystem** (6:40): Direct access to tools like Nano Banana and image generation models within the product for tasks like logo design (6:43-6:47).
- **Context-Aware Features** (10:57): The agent maintains context over all files and internet documentation, enabling features like automated code suggestions and migrations (10:59-11:10).
- **Automated Testing and Verification** (5:21, 12:22): The integrated browser allows the agent to test newly written code autonomously and provide walkthrough reports with screen recordings and screenshots (5:30-5:48).
- **Commit Message Generation** (1:17:40): The editor can automatically generate context-aware commit messages based on conversation history and file changes (1:18:20-1:18:26).
