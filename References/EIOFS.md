And it helps people, because I was using it all the time, to give the company hope that, “Hey, look, we solved this problem, we solved that problem, we solved this problem.” The markets didn’t exist, but there were important problems, and that’s what the company’s about, to solve these problems. We want to be sustainable, and therefore, the markets have to exist at some point.

But you want to decouple the result from evidence that you’re doing the right thing, okay? So that’s how you kind of solve this problem of investing into something that’s very, very far away and **having the conviction to stay on the road is to find as early as possible the indicators that you’re doing the right things**. So, start with a core belief. Unless something changes your mind, you continue to believe in it. And look for early indicators of future success.
