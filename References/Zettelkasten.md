The term "slip-box" (or "Zettelkasten" in German) refers to a practical methodology for organizing notes on paper slips. 

## Key ideas
- "**Atomic**": Each "slip" contains a single idea or piece of information.
- "**Categorize**": these slips are stored in a different "box" for later retrieval
- "**Notes**": linking slips together to form a network of interconnected ideas.
