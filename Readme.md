My personal [[References/Obsidian]] vault template. A bottom-up approach to turning fleeting [[Daily.base]] and  [[Clippings]] into a lasting, interconnected network of ideas. Take the parts you like and tailor them to your needs.

See the article [[How I use Obsidian]] for a detailed explanation of this vault structure and workflow.

## Get started

1. [Download this vault](https://github.com/kepano/kepano-obsidian/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Unzip the .zip file to a folder of your choosing
3. Open Obsidian and create a new vault pointing to that folder
